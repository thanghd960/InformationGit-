The Node.js license applies to all parts of Node.js that are not externally 
maintained libraries. 

Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation. 

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 

Preamble 

This license establishes the terms under which a given free software 
Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. 
The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic 
control over the development of that Package while still keeping the 
Package available as open source and free software. 

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this 
license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the 
terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to 
make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek 
a different licensing arrangement. 

Definitions 

    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) 
    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package. 

    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other 
    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's 
    procedures. 

    "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, 
    distribute, or modify the Package. 

    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the 
    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of 
    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard 
    Version, or a Modified Version. 

    "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it 
    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or 
    organization, to others outside of your company or organization. 

    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing 
    this Package or providing support for this Package to another 
    party. It does not mean licensing fees. 

    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been 
    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested 
    by the Copyright Holder. 

    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and 
    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright 
    Holder. 

    "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with 
    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as 
    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future. 

    "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and 
    configuration files for the Package. 

    "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, 
    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or 
    translation of the Source form. 


Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution 

(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use 
Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that 
you do not Distribute the Modified Version. 


Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version 

(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the 
Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, 
either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate 
all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At 
your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a 
Compiled form of the Package. 

(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other 
modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting 
Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such 
will be subject to the Original License. 


Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source 

(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis 
or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the 
Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs 
from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting 
any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that 
you do at least ONE of the following: 

    (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder 
    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the 
    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard 
    Version. 

    (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not 
    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In 
    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different 
    from the name of the Standard Version. 

    (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to 
    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others 
    under 

        (i) the Original License or 

        (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, 
        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same 
        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee 
        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified 
        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely 
        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor 
        Fees are allowed. 


Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version 
or Modified Versions without the Source 

(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without 
the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to 
get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be 
valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any 
time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you 
must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. 
If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty 
days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then 
you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license. 

(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without 
the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to 
the Source of the Modified Version. 


Aggregating or Linking the Package 

(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or 
Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting 
aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the 
Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other 
components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license 
apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions 
as included in the aggregation. 

(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with 
other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to 
build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that 
include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, 
provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package. 


Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version 

(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that 
merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause 
the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not 
considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the 
terms of this license. 


General Provisions 

(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or 
Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, 
modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not 
use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this 
license. 

(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified 
Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required 
to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of 
this license. 

(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, 
service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder. 

(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, 
free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any 
patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily 
infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging 
that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent 
infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the 
date that such litigation is filed. 

(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: 
THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS 
IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR 
NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL 
LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL 
BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

non-exclusive license: 

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, 
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its 
    Contributions or its Contributor Version. 

2.2. Effective Date 

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution 
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first 
distributes such Contribution. 

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope 

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under 
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the 
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. 
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a 
Contributor: 

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; 
    or 

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's 
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its 
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or 

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of 
    its Contributions. 

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, 
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with 
the notice requirements in Section 3.4). 

2.4. Subsequent Licenses 

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to 
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this 
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if 
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3). 

2.5. Representation 

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its 
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights 
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License. 

2.6. Fair Use 

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under 
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other 
equivalents. 

2.7. Conditions 

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1. 

3. Responsibilities 
------------------- 

3.1. Distribution of Source Form 

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any 
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under 
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this 
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not 
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code 
Form. 

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form 

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then: 

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code 
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of 
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code 
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more 
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and 

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the 
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter 
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work 

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, 
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for 
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered 
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the 
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this 
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software 
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of 
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered 
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary 
License(s). 

3.4. Notices 

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices 
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, 
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of 
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to 
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies. 

3.5. Application of Additional Terms 

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered 
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on 
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by 
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional 
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any 
jurisdiction. 

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation 
--------------------------------------------------- 

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this 
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to 
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with 
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) 
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must 
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered 
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute 
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a 
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 

5. Termination 
-------------- 

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically 
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become 
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular 
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such 
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an 
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the 
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have 
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular 
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor 
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the 
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License 
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after 
Your receipt of the notice. 

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent 
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, 
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version 
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to 
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 
2.1 of this License shall terminate. 

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all 
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which 
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License 
prior to termination shall survive termination.

* 6. Disclaimer of Warranty * 
* ------------------------- * 
* * 
* Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" * 
* basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or * 
* statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the * 
* Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a * 
* particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the * 
* quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. * 
* Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You * 
* (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, * 
* repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an * 
* essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is *
* authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. * 
* * 
************************************************************************ 

************************************************************************ 
* * 
* 7. Limitation of Liability * 
* -------------------------- * 
* * 
* Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort * 
* (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any * 
* Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as * 
* permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, * 
* special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character * 
* including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of * 
* goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any * 
* and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party * 
* shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This * 
* limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or * 
* personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the * 
* extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some * 
* jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of * 
* incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and * 
* limitation may not apply to You. * 
* * 
************************************************************************ 

8. Litigation 
------------- 

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the 
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal 
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that 
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. 
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring 
cross-claims or counter-claims. 

9. Miscellaneous 
---------------- 

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject 
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be 
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent 
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides 
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter 
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor. 

10. Versions of the License 
--------------------------- 

10.1. New Versions 

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or 
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a 
distinguishing version number. 

10.2. Effect of New Versions 

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version 
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, 
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license 
steward. 

10.3. Modified Versions 

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a 
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove 
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that 
such modified license differs from this License). 

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary 
Licenses 

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With 
Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the 
notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

APPLE PUBLIC SOURCE LICENSE 
Version 2.0 - August 6, 2003 
Please read this License carefully before downloading this software. By downloading or using this software, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this License. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this License, please do not download or use the software. 
Apple Note: In January 2007, Apple changed its corporate name from "Apple Computer, Inc." to "Apple Inc." This change has been reflected below and copyright years updated, but no other changes have been made to the APSL 2.0. 
1. General; Definitions. This License applies to any program or other work which Apple Inc. ("Apple") makes publicly available and which contains a notice placed by Apple identifying such program or work as "Original Code" and stating that it is subject to the terms of this Apple Public Source License version 2.0 ("License"). As used in this License: 
1.1 "Applicable Patent Rights" mean: (a) in the case where Apple is the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to Apple and (ii) that cover subject matter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent necessary to use, reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code without infringement; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject matter in Your Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code. 
1.2 "Contributor" means any person or entity that creates or contributes to the creation of Modifications. 
1.3 "Covered Code" means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof. 
1.4 "Externally Deploy" means: (a) to sublicense, distribute or otherwise make Covered Code available, directly or indirectly, to anyone other than You; and/or (b) to use Covered Code, alone or as part of a Larger Work, in any way to provide a service, including but not limited to delivery of content, through electronic communication with a client other than You. 
1.5 "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License. 
1.6 "Modifications" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof. When code is released as a series of files, a Modification is: (a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing Covered Code; and/or (b) any new file or other representation of computer program statements that contains any part of Covered Code. 
1.7 "Original Code" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work as originally made available by Apple under this License, including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made available by Apple under this License, and that has been expressly identified by Apple as such in the header file(s) of such work; and (b) the object code compiled from such Source Code and originally made available by Apple under this License 
1.8 "Source Code" means the human readable form of a program or other work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable (object code). 
1.9 "You" or "Your" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this License. For legal entities, "You" or "Your" includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, You, where "control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity. 
2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following: 
2.1 Unmodified Code. You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance: 
(a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and 
(b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6. 
2.2 Modified Code. You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also meet all of these conditions: 
(a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code; 
(b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; and 
(c) If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom You have Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available. Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth in this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site). 
2.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code. 
2.4 Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code. 
3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above. 
4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof. 
5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion. 
6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms. 
7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 
8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. 
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). 
10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names "Apple", "Mac", "Mac OS", "QuickTime", "QuickTime Streaming Server" or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. You agree not to use any Apple Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html. 
11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all. 
12. Termination. 
12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate: 
(a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach; 
(b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or 
(c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an action for patent infringement against You in that instance. 
12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party. 
13. Miscellaneous. 
13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 
13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise. 
13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute. 
13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License. 
13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control. 
13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 
13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law. 
Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exigÈ que le prÈsent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rÈdigÈs en anglais.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

                             Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
 these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
 rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 introduced by others.

   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
 libraries into non-free programs.

   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
 combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
 the library.

   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
 does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
 Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
 of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
 libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
 special circumstances.

   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
 a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
 allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
 free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
 system.

   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
 users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
 that program using a modified version of the Library.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
 be combined with the library in order to run.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
 this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
 Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
 included without limitation in the term "modification".)

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 and installation of the library.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 and what the program that uses the Library does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 Library.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
     in the event an application does not supply such function or
     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
     its purpose remains meaningful.

     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
     application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
     root function must still compute square roots.)

 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.

 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Library.

 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.

   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
 these notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 the Library into a program that is not a library.

   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 medium customarily used for software interchange.

   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 Library will still fall under Section 6.)

   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
 link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
 of these things:

     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
     executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
     to use the modified definitions.)

     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
     Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
     least three years, to give the same user the materials
     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
     than the cost of performing this distribution.

     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
     specified materials from the same place.

     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.

   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 distribute.

   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
     facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
     Sections above.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Library or works based on it.

   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 this License.

   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.

 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.

   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
 excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
 written in the body of this License.

   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.

   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 and reuse of software generally.

                             NO WARRANTY

   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
 ordinary General Public License).

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
     Lesser General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
 necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990
   Ty Coon, President of Vice

 That's all there is to it!
